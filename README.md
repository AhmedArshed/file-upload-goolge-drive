**Upload File to Google Drive**

This is a Python script that uploads a file to Google Drive using the Google Drive API. The script uses the google-auth and google-api-python-client libraries to authenticate with the Google Drive API and upload the file.

**Installation**

Before running the script, you will need to install the google-auth and google-api-python-client libraries. You can do this by running the following command:


```pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client```

**Configuration**

To use the script, you will need to create a Google Drive API project in the Google Cloud Console, and obtain a client_id.json file that contains your API credentials. You can follow these steps to set up your API credentials:

Go to the Google Cloud Console.
Create a new project, or select an existing project.
Navigate to the APIs & Services > Dashboard page.
Click the + ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES button.
Search for Google Drive API, and enable it.
Navigate to the APIs & Services > Credentials page.
Click the + CREATE CREDENTIALS button and select OAuth client ID.
Follow the prompts to configure the OAuth consent screen and create a new OAuth client ID.
Download the client_id.json file and save it in the same directory as the script.


**Usage**

To use the script, run the following command in your terminal:

```python upload_file.py --file /path/to/file --folder "My Drive/My Folder"```

Replace /path/to/file with the path to the file you want to upload, and "My Drive/My Folder" with the name of the folder in Google Drive where you want to upload the file.

When you run the script for the first time, it will prompt you to authorize access to your Google Drive account. Follow the prompts to grant access, and the script will upload the file to the specified folder in Google Drive.
